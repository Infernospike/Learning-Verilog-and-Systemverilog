# Verilog & SystemVerilog Learning Journey 🚀

Welcome to my personal learning journey into Verilog and SystemVerilog for RTL design, simulation, and VLSI development. This repo documents my hands-on practice through projects and exercises—ranging from basic logic gates to complex modules.

## 📚 Purpose
To build and showcase a solid foundation in hardware design and verification by creating a portfolio of small HDL projects.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **HDLs**: Verilog, SystemVerilog
- **Simulators**:
  - [EDAPlayground](https://edaplayground.com) (Synopsys VCS, ModelSim, etc.)
  - [Icarus Verilog](http://iverilog.icarus.com/) (`iverilog`, `vvp`)
- **Waveform Viewer**: GTKWave or EDAPlayground viewer
- **Editors**: VS Code, EDAPlayground Web Editor
